Vietnam - units unclear,2020-04-11,https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/,Vietnamese Ministry of Health,"The website no longer reports the testing data on the main page in html. It looks like the testing dat ais probably being reported in the png infographic that pops up when you click on the ""Infographic Vietnam"" link partway down the page, but the text is too small (and the png resolution is too low) for me to see exactly what the text diacritics are so I can't get a proper translation. Either way, the number that is positively the cumulative total is ""121,821"", which happens to be the same as the cumulative total reported on 2020-04-11, which suggests that the number has not been updated by the ministry of health.",121821,3014,1.239,0.031
