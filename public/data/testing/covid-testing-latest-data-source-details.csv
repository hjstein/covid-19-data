In these reports they have, since 22nd March, included a total cumulative figure of tests performed. It is not clear whether this is equivalent to the number of people tested; the fact that they also report the share of these that are positive suggests this might be the case.

Weekly epidemiological reports are also published prior to 22nd March, however, they only include figures on confirmed cases and do not include quantiative figures on the number of tests performed.

Data for 2nd April comes from the most recent Federal Ministry of Health report: these have not yet been published nationally by the Australian Department for Health since we are awaiting its latest weekly epidemiological report. The first data point is for the week ending 22nd March (143,056 cumulative tests performed). It is not clear from what date this total refers."

By combining daily snapshots, there is a large break/jump in the series from 17th to 18th March 2020. This is likely (the Government of Canada website does not make the reasoning clear, only publishes a slightly different format of table) the result of a large backlog of tests waiting to be processed. This makes the data misleading to use in time-series format prior to 18th March. We therefore only use data from 18th March onwards for comparability."

The first published figure is 762 samples tested since 29th February, as of 18th March.

It's important to note that the dates here do not refer to the number of tests on a given day (or even when results come out), but instead reflect the date of the published report.

The dashboard provides daily figures of samples tested per day (and cumulative test numbers on a separate tab). We have copied this time-series as presented in the original source. It's important to note that when figures exceed 1000, the Finnish Department of Health and Welfare report samples to the nearest hundred (e.g. 1.6k). 

From the available documention we cannot be entirely certain whether 'samples tested' refers to the number of tests or number of people tested, given the general ambiguity in the usage of these terms internationally. However, a literal interpretation of the figures as the number of samples tested is consistent with further descriptions of the testing data provided here: https://thl.fi/fi/web/infektiotaudit-ja-rokotukset/ajankohtaista/ajankohtaista-koronaviruksesta-covid-19/tilannekatsaus-koronaviruksesta.

The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: ""Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy....Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.""

This data series extends to the 27th February, when test figures were very low (9 tests per day). It is likely this is was the first day, or close to the first day of testing."

The latest update, as of 2 April, was published on the 24 March. The updates include a figure for the number of tests (‘Nombre de tests’). However the context in which the figures are published suggests that these numbers may actually refer to the number of individuals tested. A breakdown into positive and negative results are given, along with a positive test rate.

Such a breakdown seems counter-intuitive if the figures relate to the number of tests performed rather than the number of individuals tested. In the former case, it would mean that the tests from people who had two two tests – e.g. both positive – would be added to tests of people who had five tests – e.g. three negative and two positive.

The figures in the time series relate to tests performed since 24 February. In the 24 March update, in addition to the previously reported hospital tests, laboratory tests are also reported. Only the total number of laboratory tests performed between 24 February and 24 March is presented, without a time series. Our figure for 24 March adds the cumulative number of laboratory tests since 24 February (6,500) to the hospital tests figure (101,046). As such 24 March represents a break in the series."

The number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.,"To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 1 April states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 13/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 918460;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 143 labs reported 354521 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 176 labs reported 348619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127457 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we can retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week:
– By 29 March: 918460 total samples tested;
– By 22 March: 918460 – 354521 = 563939 samples tested;
– By 15 March: 563939 – 348619 = 215320 samples tested;
– By 8 March: 215320 – 127457 = 87863 samples tested.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, it is possible that these numbers will increase slightly."

Rather than providing a full time series, each release provides daily test figures for a handful of the most recent days and then shows the cumulative total prior to that. It appears that figures are retrospectively updated, because the chain of daily figures from previous releases does not perfectly agree with the cumulative total reported in subsequent releases (though the discrepancies are relatively small).

Available to us are those reports retrievable through Web Archive. The earliest is from 26 March. A report for everyday since then could not be retreived. We construct our series taking the cumulative total as reported in the most recent report, and filling in any gaps from the daily figures available in the most recent report. The daily tesing figures we provide are calculated based on the change in the this cumulative figure we contruct. As such they may disagree slightly with the figures published in earlier releases.

The source reports the number of labs reporting in a given daily or cumulative figure. These have varied over the course of the reports, and this will affect the consistency of the time series we present.

The earliest figure we have is a cumulative total (reported on the 26 March) for the 14 March. The release states that 'all laboratories in the Netherlands that perform diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 have been asked from 9 March report these data daily.' The figure given notes that 24 labs were counted in this cumulative figure. More recent releases count around 35 labs in the cumulative totals provided. But there appear to be reporting lags – the number of labs reporting for the latest one or two days are a good deal lower than for previous days."

Testing data is gathered from individual states, as reported in state health department websites, data dashboards and press releases from officials.

States currently report testing figures in a range of different ways: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.
