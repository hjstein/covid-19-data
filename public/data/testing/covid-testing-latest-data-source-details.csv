Data for 2nd April comes from the most recent Federal Ministry of Health report: these have not yet been published nationally by the Australian Department for Health since we are awaiting its latest weekly epidemiological report. The first data point is for the week ending 22nd March (143,056 cumulative tests performed). It is not clear from what date this total refers."

By combining daily snapshots, there is a large break/jump in the series from 17th to 18th March 2020. This is likely (the Government of Canada website does not make the reasoning clear, only publishes a slightly different format of table) the result of a large backlog of tests waiting to be processed.

It's important to note that the dates here do not refer to the number of tests on a given day (or even when results come out), but instead reflect the date of the published report. The report notes that: ""The difference between samples taken minus confirmed and discarded cases is due to suspected cases for which test results are pending"".

The dashboard provides daily figures of samples tested per day (and cumulative test numbers on a separate tab). We have copied this time-series as presented in the original source. It's important to note that when figures exceed 1000, the Finnish Department of Health and Welfare report samples to the nearest hundred (e.g. 1.6k). 

From the available documention we cannot be entirely certain whether 'samples tested' refers to the number of tests or number of people tested, given the general ambiguity in the usage of these terms internationally. However, a literal interpretation of the figures as the number of samples tested is consistent with further descriptions of the testing data provided [here](https://thl.fi/fi/web/infektiotaudit-ja-rokotukset/ajankohtaista/ajankohtaista-koronaviruksesta-covid-19/tilannekatsaus-koronaviruksesta).

The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: ""Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy....Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.""

This data series extends to the 27th February, when test figures were very low (9 tests per day). It is likely this is was the first day, or close to the first day of testing."

The latest update, as of 9th April, was published on the 2nd April. The updates include a figure for the number of tests (‘Nombre de tests’). However the context in which the figures are published suggests that these numbers may actually refer to the number of individuals tested. A breakdown into positive and negative results are given, along with a positive test rate.

Such a breakdown seems counter-intuitive if the figures relate to the number of tests performed rather than the number of individuals tested. In the former case, it would mean that the tests from people who had two two tests – e.g. both positive – would be added to tests of people who had five tests – e.g. three negative and two positive.

The figures in the time series relate to tests performed since 24 February. In the 24 March update, in addition to the previously reported hospital tests, laboratory tests are also reported. Only the total number of laboratory tests performed between 24 February and 24 March is presented, without a time series. Our figure for 24 March adds the cumulative number of laboratory tests since 24 February (6,500) to the hospital tests figure (101,046). As such 24 March represents a break in the series."

Note that the number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.,"To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 8 April states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 14/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 1,317,887;
– For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 143 labs reported 392,984 samples tested;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 149 labs reported 360,964 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127457 samples tested.
– For calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 48 labs reported 87,863 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person."

Figures relate to ‘Tamponi’ (the number of ‘swabs’ tested) conducted in all labs across Italy. This figure is available for each individual region separately at the source indicated. However it appears that data is missing for individual regions for particular dates – we assume that these are also missing from the aggregate total for Italy that we provide. The list of missing data, in English, can be seen at the bottom of [this data dashboard built by Franco Mossotto](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/91350339-2c97-49b5-92b8-965996530f00/page/RdlHB). 

It is clear that there are delays in timeline running up to a test being reported – both in terms of the time it takes for a symptomatic person to receive a test, and in the time for that test to then get reported in the data. For one region, Lombardy, an investigation found the latter delay to be around 3-4 days.

It is unclear whether the figures include tests pending results. But given that the stock of total tests to date is large relative to the daily number of tests, this is unlikely to affect the numbers materially.

There is significant variation in testing practices – in terms of how many tests are conducted and how they are allocated across the population – across regions and these practices have also changed over time.

Moreover, it is clear that revisions to past data are simply added to the new cumulative total, making the time series of 'daily tests' erratic.

This includes two cases where the cumulative number of people tested falls: (1) 19/03 and (2) 25/03. For case (1) see footnote 4 which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this. For case (2), we could not find the associated footnote.

It isn't clear what exact date these cumulative tests date back to, but it is earlier than 10 Feb when the source reports 938 people had been tested. Prior to the 10 Feb, the press releases provide reports of coronavirus infections for the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama port. We do not report these numbers in the time series as it is unclear how they relate to the cumulative totals.

Rather than providing a full time series, each release provides daily test figures for a handful of the most recent days and then shows the cumulative total prior to that. It appears that figures are retrospectively updated, because the chain of daily figures from previous releases does not perfectly agree with the cumulative total reported in subsequent releases (though the discrepancies are relatively small).

Available to us are those reports retrievable through Web Archive. The earliest is from 26 March. A report for everyday since then could not be retreived. We construct our series taking the cumulative total as reported in the most recent report, and filling in any gaps from the daily figures available in the most recent report. The daily tesing figures we provide are calculated based on the change in the this cumulative figure we contruct. As such they may disagree slightly with the figures published in earlier releases.

The source reports the number of labs reporting in a given daily or cumulative figure. These have varied over the course of the reports, and this will affect the consistency of the time series we present.

The earliest figure we have is a cumulative total (reported on the 26 March) for the 14 March. The release states that 'all laboratories in the Netherlands that perform diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 have been asked from 9 March report these data daily.' The figure given notes that 24 labs were counted in this cumulative figure. More recent releases count around 35 labs in the cumulative totals provided. But there appear to be reporting lags – the number of labs reporting for the latest one or two days are a good deal lower than for previous days."

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Daily figures are provided since 18 January. CDC suggest that figures within 7 days of the update “are incomplete because of the lag in time between when specimens are accessioned, testing is performed, and results are reported”. As such we only provide figures after this 7 day cut off.

The CDC documents very well what is and is not included in its published testing figures. See the source linked to above for more details."
Uruguay - units unclear,2020-04-08,http://pasteur.uy/monitor-covid-19/,Ministry of Public Health,"Cumuative figures are those reported in the most recent update, and as stored in web archive. Daily figures are those presented in the time series provided in the most recent update. The two sets of figures, however, are not consistent with each other.",,448,,0.128205605160505,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBJp0U9iKQM4NRp6FpNspkGTbeIGtRu8ct4WBrUqDMw/edit#gid=1471745180,Diana,FALSE,Ministry of Public Health,http://pasteur.uy/monitor-covid-19/,"The testing figures are labelled as tests performed ('tests realizados') in the source, but we are currnetly unsure of the right interpretation of the units.","The Ministry of Public Health in Uruguay publishes a dashboard providing daily figures of tests performed ('tests realizados'). However the context in which the figures are published suggests that these numbers may actually refer to the number of individuals tested. A breakdown into positive and negative results are given, along with a positive test rate. The number of 'positive tests' is equal to the number of confirmed cases.

Such a breakdown seems counter-intuitive if the figures relate to the number of tests performed rather than the number of individuals tested. In the former case, it would mean that the tests from people who had two two tests – e.g. both positive – would be added to tests of people who had five tests – e.g. three negative and two positive.

As well as a cumulative figure for negative and positive tests, the source provides a time series from the 22nd March onwards. However these two sets of numbers appear somewhat inconsistent. The reasons for this inconsistency are not known. The inconsistency is reflected in the data we provide: the cumulative figures we show are as published on the dashboard and recoverable through web archives; the daily figures are as given in time series provided in the most recent update.

For more detials on the construction of the series, see the observation-by-observation source notes in the data download linked to at the top of this section."
Vietnam - units unclear,2020-04-09,https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/,Vietnamese Ministry of Health,,114241,4117,1.16145619752797,0.0418563840059406,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBJp0U9iKQM4NRp6FpNspkGTbeIGtRu8ct4WBrUqDMw/edit#gid=2060618126,Automated,TRUE,Vietnamese Ministry of Health,https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/,"The source reports this as the 'number of samples tested'. However, based on the context, it is unclear whether this refers to the total number of tests conducted, or number of people who have been tested.","The Vietnamese Ministry of Health update its disease situation statistics page daily with the latest data on confirmed cases, deaths and samples tested. 

It refers to its testing data as 'samples tested', and reports confirmed cases and negative samples separately; 'sample tested' generally matches the sum of confirmed cases and negative samples (though there are occasionally some small discrepancies – we report the sum of positive and negative in this case). This would suggest that 'samples tested' is equivalent to the number of people tested. However, it's unclear whether 'negative samples' includes some instances of resampling for the same person. We therefore cannot say with certainty that these are equivalent.

Using web archives we can reconstruct a daily time-series of total samples by looking at previous versions of the updated website. These daily updates extend back to 2nd March. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that as of 2nd March 1753 samples had been tested."
